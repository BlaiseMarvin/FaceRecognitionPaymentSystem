# FaceRecognitionPaymentSystem
Design of a Face recognition payment system prototype

This project makes use of the core concepts of Edge AI computing and IOT.
We are building a Face Recognition based payment system that employs a deep learning based face recognition model.
The face recognition model is deployed on an edge device and works in tandem with a mobile/web application.
The user interacts with the system through a web/mobile application to make payments.
Validity of transaction is made by the deployable face recognition model on an edge device.
